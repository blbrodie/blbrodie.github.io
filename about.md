I am a software engineer. I have worked in Java, Erlang, Elixir, and Ruby. I
practice Extreme Programming. I believe in Test Driven Development workflows. In
addition to unit tests, I believe that writing large tests which exercise the
user interface and the whole system is an essential part of feature development.
